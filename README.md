## 1. Student Customization:
### 1.1 How to Start
- The project start from dashBoard.java. A main function locates here.

### 1.2 Special Setting, help to understand the project
- The row number is increasing from bottom to top.
- The column number is increasing from left to right.
- Human is supposed to always hold the dark piece, which means moving first.

### 1.3 The game rule I follow:
- Board: a flat 8x8 board of alternating colored squares. Only the dark squares are used: the light squares are never used.
- Move: Dark piece has the first move.
- Tunnel: the sides of the board are rolled up (or down) to create a tunnel. 
- Beat: the other player's pieces can be taken by being "jumped" over. If you can take a piece from the board, then you must jump a piece and take it from the board.
- Note: No other rules are included. 

## 2. Project general Description:
### 2.1 Project Description
Build software to play “tunnel checkers” against an opponent: 
American checkers is played on a flat 8x8 board of alternating colored squares.  The players are at opposite ends of the board and follow a set of game rules.
Tunnel checkers follows the same game rules with the two players at opposite ends.  However, the sides of the board are rolled up (or down) to create a tunnel.  E.g. a player’s piece could keep moving to forward right without bumping into a side as it moves around the tunnel board.
